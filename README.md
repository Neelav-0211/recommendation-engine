# recommendation-engine
This is a very basic implementaion of a recommendation-engine, which lays the pathwork for us to understand the working of recommendations engine of various
content delivery applications/websites.
To clone this repository and make it functional on your system you can either run the jupyter notebook code with the csv files, or you can directly use the .pkl files
and run the application. Make sure you have the dependencies installed in your environment(in requirements.txt).
